## 🕉️ About Vedic Astrology

### What is Astrology?

Astrology is an ancient practice that studies the movements and positions of celestial bodies—such as the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars—and interprets their influence on human affairs and natural phenomena. For thousands of years, cultures worldwide have observed the heavens to understand timing, personality traits, and life events.

### The Rich History of Vedic Astrology (Jyotish)

**Vedic Astrology**, known as **Jyotish** (Sanskrit: ज्योतिष, meaning "the science of light"), is one of the oldest astrological systems in the world, with roots tracing back over **5,000 years** to the Vedic period of ancient India.

#### Origins & Sacred Texts

The wisdom of Jyotish is preserved in the sacred **Vedas**, particularly the **Rigveda** and **Yajurveda**. The foundational texts include:

- **Vedanga Jyotish** (c. 1400 BCE) - The earliest known astronomical text
- **Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra** - Authored by Sage Parashara, father of Vyasa
- **Brihat Jataka** by Varahamihira (6th century CE)
- **Phaladeepika** by Mantreswara

#### Philosophy

Unlike Western astrology which primarily uses the Tropical Zodiac, Vedic astrology employs the **Sidereal Zodiac**—aligned with fixed star positions. This system is deeply interconnected with:

- **Karma & Dharma**: Understanding one's life purpose and past actions
- **Ayurveda**: The sister science of holistic health
- **Yoga**: Spiritual practices for self-realization
- **Vastu**: Sacred architecture and spatial harmony

#### The Nakshatras

Vedic astrology recognizes **27 Nakshatras** (lunar mansions)—each 13°20' of the zodiac. These provide nuanced insights into personality, timing, and destiny that are unique to this system.

#### Modern Evolution

In the 20th century, **Prof. K.S. Krishnamurti** (1908-1972) revolutionized Vedic astrology with the **KP System** (Krishnamurti Paddhati), introducing:

- Sub-lords and subdivisions for precise timing
- The ABCD significator method
- Advanced stellar astrology techniques

This scientific approach has made predictions more accurate and verifiable than ever before.

#### [**jyotish-flutter-library**](https://github.com/rajsanjib/jyotish-flutter-library) ⭐

**A heartfelt thank you to the creator of the `jyotish` library!**

This Flutter package provides the foundational astronomical calculations that power AstroFast's chart generation. Without this library's precise ephemeris computations and Vedic astrological algorithms, building accurate charts would be exponentially more complex.

The `jyotish` library handles:
- Swiss Ephemeris integration for planetary positions
- Ayanamsa calculations (Lahiri, Raman, etc.)
- Vedic chart (Rashi Kundali) generation
- Nakshatra and pada calculations
- House system implementations

If you find AstroFast useful, please show appreciation to the `jyotish` library maintainers by starring their repository!
