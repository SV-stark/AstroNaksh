## 🕉️ About Vedic Astrology

### The Science of Light

### Key Foundational Concepts
- **Nakshatras**: 27 lunar mansions providing nuanced life insights.
- **Dasha Systems**: Predictive timing based on planetary periods.
- **KP System**: A scientific refinement by Prof. K.S. Krishnamurti for high-precision predictions.
